                  <h3>What are the best ways to keep the earth clean?</h3>
                  <p>As an individual, there are lots of things you can do, starting with not littering or polluting. 
                    Dispose of everything properly, and even better, reduce your waste so that there is less to return 
                    to the landfill. Compost your food scraps and other compostables, to return nutrients to the soils. 
                    Lobby to have cleaner waters and air in your part of the world and make submissions whenever 
                    new projects are proposed that might cause more destruction of nature. Think before assuming that 
                    all human activities are either necessary or have to be done as they currently are -- think about 
                    a cleaner future and what it would take to get us there. That is a positive thing to do, not a scary 
                    thing at all.</p>
                  <h3>Why do I have to help the environment?</h3>
                  <p>You are part of the environment and your very well-being depends on the healthiness and 
                    well-being of the environment around you. Your food, your air, your water and your sense of overall 
                    well-being is all sourced from nature. Since the era of industrialisation, human beings have assumed 
                    that the planet is something to tame and control, to be outside of and apart from. As a result, many 
                    practices from factories and chemicals on the farm, to cars and mass manufacturing have left scars on 
                    the environment that we now have an obligation to heal and restore.</p>
                    <h3>What is the definition of "save the environment"?</h3>
                  <p>That is a big question with no single, easy answer! On the one hand, it's about restoring or 
                    encouraging natural processes so that the ecosystems function healthily but without assuming we 
                    can control those processes -- rather, we need to learn to live with them. It's also about restoring 
                    habitats, so that animal and plant species can survive in a healthy way. On the other hand, the phrase 
                    actually implies "save human beings" because if we don't respond effectively to such as issues as 
                    climate change, degraded ecosystems and other environment challenges, the survival of the human 
                    species is at risk. The definition really depends on which angle you're coming at it from but it might 
                    help to realize that if we muck things up so much that we cannot survive, the equilibrium will 
                    be restored without us.</p>
                    <h3>What are the advantages and disadvantages of saving the environment?</h3>
                    <p>There are lots of advantages to helping save the environment! Doing your part to help means 
                      that you are working to ensure there are enough high-quality resources for yourself and future 
                      generations. And typically when you are doing things to save the environment (like using less water, 
                      for instance) you are also saving money--which can be a huge advantage for many people! There aren't 
                      really any disadvantages to saving the environment, other than that some options require you to 
                      be more mindful of your choices (like which products you buy at the grocery store) and/or may take 
                      a little more of your time (like recycling a cereal box vs. throwing it away).</p>
